Technical writing samples.

## Overview
This repository serves as a sampler of my previous work with documenting projects and researching topics. Each document or resource accomplishes different goals and are written for different audiences. I look forward to adding more to share with interested business partners and employers in the future.

## 1: This README.md File

### 1.1: What is this?
Most GitHub repositories come with README files that serve as descriptive introductions and manuals to the projects they are tied to. While taken for granted today, these files and their shared name come from a long tradition of educating others in the computing world. It would be remiss of me to not include one in a technical writing showcase of all places.

This file's extension, .md, indicates that it is a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file. This means that any formatting you see here is based on a variety of [syntax elements](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) that are then processed and rendered as you see it in your browser. It is wonderfully easy to work with and learn, regardless of your professional background.

### 1.2: Who is this for?
You! I am glad that you have taken an interest in my work. If something is hard to understand here, please do not hesitate to contact me here on GitHub or through any of the methods I may have provided you with feedback. I have done my best to include links to more obscure terminology and topics that may not be known to professionals outside of my niches.


## 2: Bathymetry Analysis

### 2.1: What is this?
Businesses occasionally need analyses and research done on efforts prior to taking them on. This document was the deliverable for an [agile spike](http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike/) in a [geospatial](https://www.ibm.com/topics/geospatial-data)-focused project. It details potential difficulties associated with adding new functionality to a product I helped develop along with options on how to proceed.

The content within revolves around the inclusion of [bathymetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathymetry) data in the product, which is underwater elevation. Cartographers occasionally need to take into account how deep bodies of water are and will use this kind of data for accurate results. I was not familiar with the specifics for bathymetry at first, but was able to research the topic and provide this document in a timely manner.

Some details have been redacted to protect company and client interests.

### 2.2: Who is this for?
The intended audience for this document is project management. These are decision makers in the organization that already have an understanding of the product in question as well as a general understanding of bathymetric data.


## 3: Esri Integration Codebase Notes

### 3.1: What is this?
It is common for software developers to provide assisting documentation for others in their position to ramp up on new environments quickly. This document serves that purpose for specific [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) integrations. In this context, integrations refer to integrating calls to an [Application Programing Interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) into Esri's products.

Terminal commands and code are in a different font and file paths have been boldfaced to help them stand out to the reader. Some details have been redacted to protect company and client interests.

### 3.2: Who is this for?
Fellow and future developers contributing to the Esri integrations described are the intended audience. It is assumed that professionals making changes have an understanding of common concepts and tools in the industry like APIs, [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), and [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html).


## 4: Introduction to GitHub and Sourcetree

### 4.1: What is this?
Sometimes a simple How-To guide is all it takes to start a transformation within a company. This document serves as a starting point for understanding and making use of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) as part of existing professional workflows. It is another modified but real deliverable with a focus on getting GitHub and Sourcetree to work together in an environment that requires the use of [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) keys.

Just like the README you are currently reading, this guide is also a Markdown file. Boldfaced text is generally used to identify matching text in user interface (UI) elements in programs and websites referenced in the guide.

### 4.2: Who is this for?
This document is mainly for a technical writer audience looking to set up GitHub and Sourcetree to adopt a [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) process for internal and external documentation. These are writers that understand intricate, technical processes that just need a primer on setting these technologies up according to a company's standards.
